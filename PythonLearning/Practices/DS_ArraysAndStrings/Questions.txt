String Controls

1. Reverse String : https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/description/
( the key is to be in-place )

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

2. Finding maxmium / minimum element in the array 

def findMax(nums):
    maxNum = nums[0]
    for i in nums:
        maxNum = max(maxNum , i)
    return(maxNum)


b = findMax([1,2,3,4,5,46,546,546,435,6,234,234,1234,235,12345,43])
print(b)

Practice Problems:

Reverse an array or string.

Find the maximum/minimum element in an array.

Check if a string is a palindrome.

Count the frequency of elements in an array or characters in a string.

Practice Problems:

Remove duplicates from a list using a set.

Count the frequency of words in a string using a dictionary.

Merge two dictionaries.

3. Dive into Algorithms
Learn and implement basic algorithms using arrays and strings:

Sorting Algorithms: Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort.

Searching Algorithms: Linear search, binary search.

String Algorithms: Pattern matching (e.g., using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm).
