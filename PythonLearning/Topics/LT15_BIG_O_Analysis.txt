1. What's the need for Complexity Analysis
which approach is better 
why care which is better 
what does better mean  (faster and less memory) 

Time Complexity / Space Complexity

2. Time Complexity 
different machines are different time. so not only count on time 
count number of simple operations that computer has to do 
sometimes more on like which data structure to use in order to implment the solution 

3. Asymptotic Analysis  --> expressed as Big O notation
