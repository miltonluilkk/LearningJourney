DataStructures 

Python : arrays are typically represented using lists
# lists are dynamic - size can change 
# can hold elements of different types 
# best practice use homogeneous data types for arrays

Key Characteristics of Python Lists:
#Dynamic Size: Lists can grow or shrink as needed.
#Indexed: Elements are accessed using indices (starting from 0).
#Mutable: Elements can be modified after creation.
#Heterogeneous: Can store elements of different types (but avoid this for arrays).

# Declare a list (array) of integers
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(arr)  # Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
