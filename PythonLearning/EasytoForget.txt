1. cant return .sort() --> because it will return None
2. The array new_array should be initialized with a specific size before elements can be assigned to indices
In Python, attempting to assign a value to an index in a list that does not yet exist will raise an IndexError.
 Since new_array is initialized as an empty list, there are no indices to assign values to,
 and the statement new_array[i] = array[i] ** 2 will fail. The correct approach would be to either use append() to add each squared value to the list or 
initialize the list with predefined size and default values, as was done in the original function.
3. join() is to concat the items !!! very importantly , it's for the itreable items

words = ["Hello", "world", "this", "is", "Python"]
sentence = " ".join(words)
print(sentence)
#output : Hello world this is Python


chars = "Python"
result = "-".join(chars)
print(result)
#Output : P-y-t-h-o-n


# Time = O(n) Space = O(n)
def sorted_squared(array):
    i = 0
    j = len(array) - 1
    new_array = [0] * len(array)
    for k in reversed(range(len(array))):
        sq_i = array[i]**2
        sq_j = array[j]** 2
        if sq_i > sq_j:
            new_array[k] = sq_i
            i += 1
        else:
            new_array[k] = sq_j
            j -= 1
    return new_array


print(sorted_squared([-5,-4,-2, 1, 9,12]))
