What did I learn from each leetcode 

techniques :

1. for loop (1,n) 
i in range(1,n)
num[i] == num[i-1] # comparing the number vs number + 1 in the list 

2. for loop each combination
i in range(n)
 j in range(i + 1, n) 
 
3. hashmap.get(i, 0) + 1 ## Getting the coutners of the numbers 

4. collections ## defaultdict(list) 
this can append the item to the dict as 
key : values in list ... 

5. ord(c) - ord('a') ## returning to the ASCII code 

---------------------------------

1. Contains Duplicate

This is an easy question that to think about
so thinking of 2 scenarios 
[1,2,3,3]  # Output : True
[1,2,3,4]  # Output : False

The first thought coming out would be forloop each of the numbers twice so it would be accomplished.. how to do this ?? it will be good to remember

i --> it will for loop the whole set once
j --> it will for loop the i+1, so it's forever 1 step ahead of i --> when it's the last number , i,e for example it's [1,2,3,4] when it's i==3 -> num[3] , 
it will be range(3+1,4) so it will not compare.. so it's working

n = len(nums)
for i in range(n):
	for j in range(i+1, n):
		if nums[i] == nums[j]:
			return(True)
return(False) 

The second thought coming out would also be easy, that's also forloop and this is actually a sorting method to find it out
I think this is actually a good solution given for a support/automations as to resolve the problems
the learning thing is - if you want to loop the list once and compare the n vs n+1 number, we can loop 1,n, and compare n vs n-1 to avoid out of index issue 

n = len(nums)
for i in range(1, n):
	if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
		return(True)
return(False)

Hash ways 
This is only when getting involved to leetcode, then we know about the hash ways

this is a veru clean solution, if the map contains the value then return true.
fast and clean solution 

hm = set()
for i in nums:
	if i in hm:
		return(True)
	else:
		hm.add(i)
return(False) 

bonus comparing the length of the list would be cleanest solution and seems only suitable for this solution
return( len(set(nums))  < len(nums) 

2. Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example 1:

Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

Output: true

This question is the topic to let you to compute the map and compared 
first of the tricky solution is to sort and compare 

1. return(sorted(s) == sorted(t))  # this is tricky one and not applied to other situations

2. the general another idea is to generate the map of the characters 

for example , tac vs act 

there would be a map if you forloop both 

for i in s:
	hm_S[i] = hm.get(i, 0) + 1
for i in t:
	hm_T[i] = hm.get(i, 0) + 1
then comparing both the maps will be an answer

of course to combine it will be a cleaner soltuion

countS, countT = {}, {}
for i in range(len(s)) 
	countS[s[i]] = countS.get(s[i], 0 ) +1
	countT[t[i]] = countT.get(s[i], 0 ) +1

3. solution from leetcode. this is very clever to take the ASCII code in order to compute the question's answer

count = [0] * 26 ## because there would be 26 characters of english 
if len(s) != len(t):
	return(False) # this would be applicable to all situations, if length diff, it will be diff
for i in range(len(s)):
	count[ord(s[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
	count[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1

for i in count:
	if i != 0:
		return(False)
return(True) 

# this is very clever solution , as if all = 0 it means they add and subtract later on


3. Two Sum 

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

Example 1:

Input: 
nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

Output: [0,1]


this is basically the most common question , this is array and hash table answer

so it's using the hash map in order to make it happen, but before that, we should learn about logically how we resolve the issue.. 
that's it's to use nested loop to loop through the number 

the key point to note is ,
first is to for loop the n terms, 
if second would like to loop through the remaining item, it's to do it with 1+i , n

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                currsum = nums[i] + nums[j]
                if currsum == target:
                    return([i, j])
        return[]


2. using the hashmap 
hm ={}
for k ,v in enumerate(nums):
	if v in hm:
		return([hm[v], k]) 
	else:
		hm[target - v] = k



4. 

Group Anagrams
Solved 
Given an array of strings strs, group all anagrams together into sublists. You may return the output in any order.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["act","pots","tops","cat","stop","hat"]

Output: [["hat"],["act", "cat"],["stop", "pots", "tops"]]


This is the question to map the same characters item into particular item key.... very easy to think of the key values pair to append the values
To do this, we are going to sort the key , and then to append the items.  quite straight forward after reading the answers

res = defaultdict(list)
for s in strs:
    sortedS = ''.join(sorted(s))
    res[sortedS].append(s)
return list(res.values())

another way to put that down is to use the hash map in order to append the item...
in the below, it's using the buckets to append the numbers, which is very clever , and +1 for each of the item added. 
this is a good one and can remember down for the next time

res = defaultdict(list)
for s in strs:
    count = [0] * 26
    for c in s:
      count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
      res[tuple(count)].append(s)
return list(res.values())


5. 
[-3, 0 , 1,2,5] ---> return to a squared list [0,1,4,9,25] 
# Time = O(n) Space = O(n)
def sorted_squared(array):
    i = 0
    j = len(array) - 1
    new_array = [0] * len(array)
    for k in reversed(range(len(array))):
        sq_i = array[i]**2
        sq_j = array[j]** 2
        if sq_i > sq_j:
            new_array[k] = sq_i
            i += 1
        else:
            new_array[k] = sq_j
            j -= 1
    return new_array


print(sorted_squared([-5,-4,-2, 1, 9,12]))
