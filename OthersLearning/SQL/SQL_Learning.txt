1. Foundational SQL Concepts
These are the basics you must be comfortable with:

a. SQL Syntax and Queries
SELECT statements: Retrieving data from tables.

WHERE clause: Filtering data based on conditions.

ORDER BY: Sorting results.

LIMIT/OFFSET: Limiting the number of rows returned.

DISTINCT: Selecting unique values.

b. Joins
INNER JOIN: Combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

LEFT/RIGHT JOIN: Including all rows from one table and matching rows from another.

FULL OUTER JOIN: Combining all rows from both tables.

Self-Join: Joining a table to itself.

c. Aggregations
GROUP BY: Grouping rows that have the same values.

HAVING: Filtering groups based on conditions.

Aggregate functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX().

d. Data Manipulation
INSERT: Adding new rows to a table.

UPDATE: Modifying existing rows.

DELETE: Removing rows from a table.

e. Data Definition
CREATE TABLE: Creating new tables.

ALTER TABLE: Modifying table structure.

DROP TABLE: Deleting tables.

f. Constraints
PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifying each row.

FOREIGN KEY: Enforcing relationships between tables.

UNIQUE: Ensuring all values in a column are unique.

NOT NULL: Ensuring a column cannot have NULL values.

CHECK: Ensuring values meet specific conditions.

2. Intermediate SQL Concepts
These are more advanced topics that are often tested in interviews:

a. Subqueries
Writing nested queries to solve complex problems.

Using subqueries in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses.

b. Window Functions
ROW_NUMBER(): Assigning a unique number to each row.

RANK(): Assigning a rank to rows within a partition.

DENSE_RANK(): Similar to RANK(), but without gaps.

LEAD()/LAG(): Accessing data from subsequent or previous rows.

c. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Using WITH clauses to create temporary result sets for complex queries.

d. Set Operations
UNION: Combining results from multiple queries.

INTERSECT: Finding common rows between queries.

EXCEPT: Finding rows in one query but not in another.

e. Indexes
Understanding how indexes work and when to use them.

Types of indexes: Clustered vs. Non-Clustered.

3. Advanced SQL Concepts
These are highly relevant for hedge fund roles, as they deal with large datasets and complex queries:

a. Performance Optimization
Writing efficient queries.

Understanding query execution plans.

Avoiding common pitfalls like SELECT * and unnecessary joins.

b. Transactions
ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK.

c. Stored Procedures and Functions
Writing reusable SQL code.

Understanding the difference between procedures and functions.

d. Handling Financial Data
Working with time-series data (e.g., stock prices, trades).

Calculating moving averages, returns, and volatility.

Handling NULL values and missing data.

e. Data Import/Export
Loading data from CSV files or other sources.

Exporting query results to files.

4. Practical Applications for Hedge Funds
Since you’re interviewing for a hedge fund app support role, you should be familiar with SQL applications in finance:

a. Portfolio Analysis
Calculating portfolio returns, risk metrics, and performance attribution.

Aggregating positions and transactions.

b. Trade Data
Querying trade execution data.

Analyzing slippage, fill rates, and transaction costs.

c. Market Data
Querying and analyzing stock prices, indices, and other market data.

Handling OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data.

d. Risk Management
Querying exposure data.

Calculating Value-at-Risk (VaR) and other risk metrics.

e. Reporting
Generating reports for traders, portfolio managers, and risk teams.

Using SQL to create summary tables and dashboards.

5. Practice Problems
To solidify your knowledge, practice the following types of problems:

Basic Queries

Retrieve all trades for a specific stock.

Find the top 5 performing stocks by return.

Joins

Combine trade data with market data to calculate execution prices.

Join portfolio holdings with security master data.

Aggregations

Calculate the average daily volume for a stock.

Find the total P&L for a portfolio.

Window Functions

Calculate a 30-day moving average for a stock price.

Rank stocks by their daily returns.

Subqueries and CTEs

Find stocks that outperformed the market index.

Calculate cumulative returns for a portfolio.

Optimization

Rewrite a slow query to improve performance.

Analyze an execution plan and identify bottlenecks.

6. Tools and Platforms
SQL Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle.

Financial Databases: Bloomberg Terminal, FactSet, Refinitiv (if applicable).

Practice Platforms: LeetCode, HackerRank, SQLZoo, Mode Analytics.

7. Interview Tips
Understand the Role: Hedge fund app support often involves troubleshooting, data analysis, and working with traders. Be prepared to explain how SQL fits into these tasks.

Practice Real-World Scenarios: Be ready to write queries on the spot or optimize existing ones.

Explain Your Thought Process: Interviewers value clear communication and problem-solving skills.

Brush Up on Finance Basics: Understand terms like P&L, NAV, VaR, and portfolio construction.

By mastering these concepts and practicing real-world problems, you’ll be well-prepared for your SQL interview in a hedge fund app support role. Let me know if you’d like further clarification or practice problems!
