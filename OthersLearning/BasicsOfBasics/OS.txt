OS: 

An Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware. 
It manages hardware resources, provides common services for applications, and ensures that different programs and users running on
 the computer don’t interfere with each other.
 
Key Points:
Purpose of an OS:
Manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.).
Provides a user interface (e.g., GUI or command line).
Runs applications and ensures they work efficiently.

Examples of OS:
Desktop OS: Windows, macOS, Linux.
Mobile OS: Android, iOS.
Server OS: Linux distributions (Ubuntu Server, CentOS).

Key Functions of an OS
The OS performs several critical functions to ensure the computer operates smoothly. Let’s break them down:

A. Process Management
The OS manages processes (running instances of programs).
It handles:
Multitasking: Running multiple processes simultaneously.
Scheduling: Deciding which process gets CPU time and when.
Synchronization: Ensuring processes don’t interfere with each other.

B. Memory Management
The OS manages the computer’s memory (RAM).

It handles:
Allocation: Assigning memory to processes.
Deallocation: Freeing memory when a process finishes.
Virtual Memory: Using disk space as an extension of RAM when physical memory is full.

C. File System Management
The OS organizes and manages files and directories on storage devices.

It handles:

File Creation/Deletion: Creating and deleting files.
File Access: Controlling who can read/write files.
Storage Allocation: Managing disk space efficiently.

D. Device Management
The OS communicates with hardware devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, printer).
It uses device drivers to interact with hardware.

E. Security and Access Control
The OS protects the system from unauthorized access.

It handles:

User Authentication: Verifying user identities (e.g., passwords).
Permissions: Controlling access to files and resources.

F. Networking
The OS manages network connections and communication.
It handles protocols like TCP/IP for internet communication.

3. Types of Operating Systems
Different types of OS are designed for specific use cases:

A. Batch OS
Executes jobs in batches (e.g., payroll systems).
No user interaction while the job is running.

B. Time-Sharing OS
Allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously.
Example: UNIX.

C. Real-Time OS
Used for time-critical applications (e.g., robotics, embedded systems).
Guarantees response within a specific time frame.

D. Distributed OS
Manages a group of independent computers as a single system.
Used in large-scale systems (e.g., cloud computing).

E. Mobile OS
Designed for mobile devices (e.g., Android, iOS).

4. OS Architecture
The OS is structured in layers, with the kernel at its core.

A. User Mode vs. Kernel Mode
User Mode:

Where applications run.
Limited access to hardware.

Kernel Mode:

Where the OS runs.
Full access to hardware.

B. Kernel Types
Monolithic Kernel:
All OS services run in kernel mode (e.g., Linux).

Microkernel:
Only essential services run in kernel mode; others run in user mode (e.g., macOS).


7. Key Takeaways
An OS manages hardware and software resources.
Key functions include process management, memory management, file system management, device management, security, and networking.
Types of OS include batch, time-sharing, real-time, distributed, and mobile OS.
The kernel is the core of the OS, running in kernel mode with full hardware access.


=== Lesson 2: Process Management ===

Objective: Learn how the OS manages processes and threads.

=== Topics Covered ===

1. Process vs. Thread:
   - Process: An instance of a running program.
   - Thread: A smaller unit of a process that can run independently.
   - Multithreading: A single process can have multiple threads.

2. Process States:
   - New: Process is being created.
   - Ready: Process is waiting to be assigned to the CPU.
   - Running: Process is being executed by the CPU.
   - Waiting: Process is waiting for an event (e.g., I/O completion).
   - Terminated: Process has finished execution.

3. Process Scheduling:
   - Scheduling Algorithms:
     - First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS): Executes processes in the order they arrive.
     - Shortest Job Next (SJN): Executes the shortest job first.
     - Round Robin (RR): Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum).
     - Priority Scheduling: Executes processes based on priority.

4. Inter-Process Communication (IPC):
   - Methods for processes to communicate:
     - Pipes: One-way communication between processes.
     - Shared Memory: Multiple processes access the same memory space.
     - Message Queues: Processes send/receive messages.

5. Concurrency and Synchronization:
   - Race Condition: When multiple processes access shared data simultaneously.
   - Deadlock: When processes are stuck waiting for each other.
   - Solutions:
     - Semaphores: Controls access to shared resources.
     - Mutexes: Ensures only one process accesses a resource at a time.

---

=== Practical Exercises ===

1. Process Exploration:
   - Open Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (macOS).
   - Identify the process consuming the most CPU.

2. Write a Simple Program:
   - In C:
     - Use fork() to create a child process.
     - Example:
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <unistd.h>
       int main() {
           pid_t pid = fork();
           if (pid == 0) {
               printf("Child Process\n");
           } else {
               printf("Parent Process\n");
           }
           return 0;
       }
   - In Python:
     - Use the threading module to create threads.
     - Example:
       import threading
       def print_numbers():
           for i in range(5):
               print(i)
       thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
       thread.start()

         page_faults = 0
         for page in pages:
             if page not in s:
                 if len(s) == capacity:
                     s.remove(indexes.pop(0))
                 s.add(page)
                 indexes.append(page)

         for request in requests:
             total_seek += abs(request - head)
             head = request
         return total_seek
